# BANK OF FLATIRON
The project is a transactions management system that allows users to see a table of all transactions, add new transactions, and filter transactions by typing into the search bar.

The main functionality of the project includes:

A table that displays all transactions, including the date, description, and amount.
A form that allows users to add new transactions to the table. The new transaction will be displayed in the table immediately upon submission, but it will not be persisted to the backend.
A search bar that allows users to filter the transactions table by description. Only transactions with a matching description will be displayed in the table.


It is important to note that since the new transaction does not have to be persisted to the backend it will not be saved when the page is reloaded.
